## 2. The Secret Sauce 🍯: Spaced Repetition and AI-Powered Flashcards 

### 2.1. Spaced Repetition: A Scientifically Proven Solution to Learn 🧬

Fortunately, there's a scientifically proven technique that can make learning more efficient: spaced repetition. This method involves reviewing information at increasing time intervals, leveraging how our brain forms and consolidates long-term memories.

To implement spaced repetition effectively, we turn to Anki, a free flashcard application that optimizes the learning process by automatically scheduling reviews based on your performance. Anki ensures that you review your flashcards just at the right time to maximize retention.

### 2.3. AnkiLingoFlash: a Web Extension for Automatically Creating Clever Flashcards 🧠

#### 2.3.1 Why should you adopt AnkiLingoFlash? 🌟

While Anki is powerful, creating flashcards manually can still be tedious. This is where AnkiLingoFlash comes in. AnkiLingoFlash is a browser extension designed to make flashcard creation effortless and quick. It uses artificial intelligence to instantly generate quality cards from any word or phrase you select on a web page.

Typically, the level we strive for is being able to communicate fluently and clearly in any situation, without necessarily being an expert in the language. For example, to reach the B2 level, which is considered fluent, you need to know around 4,000 words. With AnkiLingoFlash, you can achieve this level in under 9 months by dedicating just 20 minutes a day to learning 15 new cards and reviewing existing ones. This means you can rapidly build a strong foundation in your target language, and with some additional practice, you'll be speaking confidently in no time! 🚀

#### 2.3.2 Which languages are currently supported? 🌐

AnkiLingoFlash supports the following languages, including English 🇬🇧, French 🇫🇷, Spanish 🇪🇸, German 🇩🇪, Italian 🇮🇹, Portuguese 🇵🇹, and Danish 🇩🇰.
