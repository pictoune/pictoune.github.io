    "content": "After installing Anki-Connect and AwesomeTTS, you need to configure AnkiLingoFlash to choose how you’ll use the extension. Here’s how to do it: . | Click on the AnkiLingoFlash icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension popup. | In the popup, you’ll see two options: . | Free trial: Start with a limited number of free flashcards. | Own credits: Use your own OpenAI API credits for unlimited flashcards. | . | If you choose the free trial: . | Click on the Sign in with Google button. | Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Google account. | Once logged in, you’ll see a welcome message and the number of free flashcards remaining. | . | If you choose to use your own credits: . | You’ll need to use your own OpenAI API key, which is very cost-effective (a dollar can generate thousands of flashcards). | Follow these steps to create and use an OpenAI API key: . a. Create an OpenAI Account: Go to the ChatGPT website and sign up for an account. b. Generate an API Key: . | Navigate to the API keys section. | Click on “Create new secret key”. | Choose a name for your key, such as “AnkiLingoFlash”. | Click on “Create secret key”. | Note down the generated key. | . c. Add Funds to Your Account: . | In the OpenAI dashboard, go to the “Settings” menu. | Navigate to the “Billing” section. | Add a minimum of $5 USD (or equivalent) to your account. | . d. Use the API Key in AnkiLingoFlash: . | Copy your API key and paste it into the settings of the AnkiLingoFlash extension. | . | . | Select the language for definitions and mnemonics: . | Choose from available options: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Portugal), German, Italian, or Danish. | . | . Note: If you’re unsure about using your own credits, don’t worry! Even if you don’t generate enough flashcards to use the entire $5, you can still use the remaining credits in OpenAI’s playground or for other AI-powered tools and experiments. Fantastic progress!
