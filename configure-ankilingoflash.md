# Configuring AnkiLingoFlash

After installing Anki-Connect and AwesomeTTS, it's important to configure AnkiLingoFlash to suit your learning needs. Here's how to do it:

1. Click on the AnkiLingoFlash icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension popup.

2. In the popup, you'll see two options:
   - <i><strong>Free trial</strong></i>: Start with a limited number of free flashcards.
   - <i><strong>Own credits</strong></i>: Use your own OpenAI API credits for unlimited flashcards.

3. If you choose the free trial:
   - Click on the <i><strong>Sign in with Google</strong></i> button.
   - Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Google account.
   - Once logged in, you'll see a welcome message and the number of free flashcards remaining.

4. If you choose to use your own credits or have exhausted your free trial:
   - You'll need to use your own OpenAI API key, which is very cost-effective (a dollar can generate thousands of flashcards).
   - Follow these steps to create and use an OpenAI API key:

     a. <strong>Create an OpenAI Account</strong>: Go to the [ChatGPT website](https://chatgpt.com/auth/login) and sign up for an account.

     b. <strong>Generate an API Key</strong>:
     - Navigate to the [API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
     - Click on "Create new secret key".
     - Choose a name for your key, such as "AnkiLingoFlash".
     - Click on "Create secret key".
     - Note down the generated key.

     c. <strong>Add Funds to Your Account</strong>:
     - In the OpenAI dashboard, go to the "Settings" menu.
     - Navigate to the "Billing" section.
     - Add a minimum of $5 USD (or equivalent) to your account.

     d. <strong>Use the API Key in AnkiLingoFlash</strong>:
     - Copy your API key and paste it into the settings of the AnkiLingoFlash extension.

5. Select the language for definitions and mnemonics:
   - Choose from available options: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Portugal), German, Italian, or Danish.

Now that you've configured AnkiLingoFlash, it's time to put it to use! Let's move on to [Generating Your First Flashcard]({% link generate-your-first-flashcard.md %}).
