# Configuring AnkiLingoFlash

After installing Anki-Connect and AwesomeTTS, you need to configure AnkiLingoFlash. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the AnkiLingoFlash icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension popup.

2. In the popup, you'll see two options. Choose one:

   ## Option A: Free Trial
   - Click on the <i><strong>Sign in with Google</strong></i> button.
   - Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Google account.
   - Once logged in, you'll see a welcome message and the number of free flashcards remaining.

   ## Option B: Use Your Own OpenAI Credits
   This option provides unlimited flashcards and is very cost-effective (a dollar can generate thousands of flashcards).

   1. <strong>Create an OpenAI Account</strong>: Go to the [ChatGPT website](https://chatgpt.com/auth/login) and sign up for an account.

   2. <strong>Generate an API Key</strong>:
      - Navigate to the [API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
      - Click on "Create new secret key".
      - Choose a name for your key, such as "AnkiLingoFlash".
      - Click on "Create secret key".
      - Note down the generated key.

   3. <strong>Add Funds to Your Account</strong>:
      - In the OpenAI dashboard, go to the "Settings" menu.
      - Navigate to the "Billing" section.
      - Add a minimum of $5 USD (or equivalent) to your account.

   4. <strong>Use the API Key in AnkiLingoFlash</strong>:
      - Copy your API key and paste it into the settings of the AnkiLingoFlash extension.

3. Select the language for definitions and mnemonics:
   - Choose from available options: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Portugal), German, Italian, or Danish.

Note: If you're unsure about using your own credits, don't worry! Even if you don't generate enough flashcards to use the entire $5, you can still use the remaining credits in OpenAI's playground or for other AI-powered tools and experiments.

Fantastic progress! You've successfully configured AnkiLingoFlash. Now, let's move on to [Generating Your First Flashcard]({% link generate-your-first-flashcard.md %}).
