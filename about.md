# About AnkiLingoFlash

## üéØ The Mission
AnkiLingoFlash is a web browser extension aiming to make language learning more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable for everyone. It has been designed to help you reach your language learning goals faster than ever before.

## üåü The Values

1. **‚ö° Efficiency**: AnkiLingoFlash is designed to minimise the number of actions (e.g., clicks) required from the user to create a flashcard. I've also kept the experience ad-free, allowing you to focus solely on learning.

2. **üîí Privacy**: Your API key is only stored locally on your device and is encrypted for added security. I do not collect or store this information.

3. **üîÑ Continuous Improvement**: AnkiLingoFlash will be updated based on user feedback and feature requests. Here's the list of updates:
   - Version 0.5.x:
     - Added support for the Google Gemini API
     - Added Persian (Farsi) to the list of supported languages
   - Version 0.4.x:
     - Each card now includes 3 example sentences tailored to the user's learning objective
     - Replaced AwesomeTTS with HyperTTS, allowing users to use their own API key for text-to-speech audio generation
     - Users can now disable mnemonic generation by default
     - Added the ability to generate a "reverse card" with a single click, enhancing bidirectional learning
   - Version 0.3.x: 
     - Added direct translation of the selected term on the back of the flashcard
     - Minor design improvements for a more harmonious look
     - The extension's homepage is now integrated into the main website for a seamless experience
     - More explicit error messages for better user understanding
     - Expanded language support, allowing flashcard creation in many more languages (quality may vary depending on OpenAI's model performance)
   - Version 0.2.x: 
     - Optimised token usage, resulting in more efficient API calls
     - Users with their own API key can now choose OpenAI models besides gpt-4 for enhanced flashcard generation

4. **üåç Open Source**: AnkiLingoFlash is an open-source project, licensed under the **MIT License**. This license allows you to use, modify, distribute, and even use the software commercially, provided you credit the author. You can view the source code and contribute on GitHub:
