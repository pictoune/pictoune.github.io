# Configuring the Text-to-Speech Tool

To add pronunciation guides to your flashcards, you need to configure the text-to-speech tool for your target language. Follow these steps:

1. Generate your first flashcard as described in the previous step.

2. In Anki, go to <i><strong>Tools > Manage Note Types</strong></i>.

3. You should see the flashcard type corresponding to the language of the word or phrase you selected. For example, if you selected an English term, look for <i><strong>AnkiLingoFlash_English [1 note]</strong></i>.

4. Select the appropriate card type and click on <i><strong>Cards...</strong></i>.

5. In the card editor:
   - Check the <i><strong>Back Template</strong></i>.
   - Click on <i><strong>OK</strong></i> to dismiss any message that appears.
   - Click on <i><strong>Add TTS</strong></i>.

6. Configure the text-to-speech service:
   - Select the service you want to use. For example, for English, you can choose the free local service <i><strong>Youdao Dictionary</strong></i>.
   - Choose the appropriate voice (e.g., <i><strong>English, American [default]</strong></i> for English).
   - Click on <i><strong>Save</strong></i>, then on <i><strong>OK</strong></i>.

7. Set up the TTS fields:
   - For the <i><strong>Field</strong></i> option, select <i><strong>Selection</strong></i>.
   - For the <i><strong>Language</strong></i> field, select the desired language for text-to-speech.

8. Finalize the setup:
   - Click on <i><strong>Insert into Back Template</strong></i>.
   - Close the message that appears by clicking on <i><strong>OK</strong></i>.
   - In the Back Template, find the line <i><strong>[Text-to-speech not yet configured]</strong></i> and replace it with the line that was just added (it should contain the TTS tag).
   - Click on <i><strong>Save</strong></i>.

**Important**: You will need to repeat this process for each language you wish to learn.
