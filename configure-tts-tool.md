# Configuring the Text-to-Speech Tool

To add pronunciation guides to your flashcards, you need to configure AwesomeTTS in Anki:

1. In Anki, go to Tools > Manage Note Types
2. Select the note type created by AnkiLingoFlash (e.g., "AnkiLingoFlash_English")
3. Click "Cards..."
4. In the "Back Template" section, click "Add TTS"
5. Choose your preferred TTS service (e.g., Google Cloud TTS)
6. Select the appropriate voice for your target language
7. Set the "Field" to "Front" (or the field containing the word to be pronounced)
8. Click "Insert into Back Template"
9. Adjust the placement of the [sound:] tag in your template as desired
10. Click "Save"

Now your AnkiLingoFlash cards will include pronunciation audio when reviewed in Anki.
